# WSS2 Website

This repository contains a static website ready to run with a modern dev server.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Project structure

- `index.html` — main entry point (WSS2 interaction experience).
- `public/assets/` — static image assets referenced by the page.
- `archive/` — legacy HTML exports kept for reference.
